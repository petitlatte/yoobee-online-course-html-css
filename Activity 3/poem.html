	<h1>The Last Invocation</h1>
	<b>By Walt Whitman, 1819-1892</b>
	<p>
	At the last, tenderly,<br>
	From the walls of the powerful fortress'd house,<br>
	From the clasp of the knitted locks, from the keep of the well-closed doors,<br>
	Let me be wafted.
	</p>
	<p>
	Let me glide noiselessly forth;<br>
	With the key of softness unlock the locks - with a whisper,<br>
	Set open the doors O soul.
	</p>
	<p>
	Tenderly - be not impatient,<br>
	<i>(Strong is your hold O mortal flesh,<br>
	Strong is your hold O love)</i>
	</p>
