		<p>Tinkerbelle's owner was no longer able to care for her, so she was taken in a a friend. Unfortunately, the incumbent cat was not happy with Tinkerbelle's arrival and began to bully her. She's come to the shelter for a chance at a new life. In her previous home, Tinkerbelle spent most of her time indoors. She is shy initially, but with a little patience and a slow approach, she really enjoys being patted.</p>

		<p>Tinkerbelle has lived with another cat happily, and seems comfortable with the other cat friendly cats at the shelter, so may be fine living with another quiet, cat-friendly cat.</p>

		<p>Tinkerbelle would suit a quiet, stable home where she doesn't have to go through more upheaval. Tinkerbelle's adoption fee is $80</p>
