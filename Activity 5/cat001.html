		<p>Celine turned up on the doorstep as a wary kitten with very little socialisation. Her rescuer spent many months building up her trust, and eventually got Celine to a point where she could be handled. Unfortunately, the landlord wasn't happy with cats on the property, so Celine came to us to continue growing her confidence and find a perfect home.</p>

		<p>After a few months of quiet and consistent attention from our volunteers, Celine has blossomed from a hissy, scared kitten into a playful and curious cat. Celine now feels confident enough to play with visitors and greet our volunteers for breakfast. Celine is a social girl who loves to be around other young, bubbly cats. She can often be found playing chase with Leah around the shelter. Due to her background, Celine would need to be an indoor cat for an extended period of time to ensure she feels fully bonded with her new people.</p>

		<p>Celine would suit a quiet home with other young, cat friendly cats. Celine's adoption fee is $80.</p>
